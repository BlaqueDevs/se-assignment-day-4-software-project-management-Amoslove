# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Answere:when a project is delivered on time,the client are always satisfied in otherword it ensure customer's satisfaction.
it also increases clients confidence for the team or organization, it maintains budget.
the project manager can ensure the deadlines are met  by defining the project scope, breaking work down into manageable sprint, make sure to communicate effectively with thhe team. the PM can also adopt agile methodologies ,also make sure the right number of people are available for the project.




## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

ANSWERE:iffective cost control prevent budget overrun,it ensures fast completion of the project.it also prevents shortage of funds.
how to prevent over budget: the first is a good budget planning, cheking regularly what has been spent so far and keep expenses under control


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

ANSWERE: both waterfall and agile methodologies are software development methodologies used to manage projects.
waterfall is linear,each phase of the project must be completed befor starting another, and it is more like a a static project where the requirement won't change, it requires extensive planning before development while agile is more flexible and focuses on small rapid cycle called sprint,agile is more like  dynamic project  where its reqirements are incremental, planing is continious in agile because agile can adapt to changes unlike waterfall.

avantage of agile:it is flexible,it easily adapt to changes and allows modification.
disadvantage:it can lead to budget overrun.

advantage of waterfall:works with a fixed budget.
disadvantage: it delays in product delivery.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

ANSWERE: agile is more beneficial in projects that requires changes  ,projects that reqires contineous improvement e.g e-commerce, social media app
while waterfall is beneficila in projects that has a clear and static reqirement that won't change e.g healthcare app etc


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

ANSWERE: effective planning
definning  the project scope, clearly define all the project requirement to avoid scop creep. effevtive analysis, contineous monitoring and effective communication.

its important to maintain a high standard because it builds trust
and confidents in the product users, it also reduces cost, poor quality can lead to budget overrun, etc

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

ANSWERE: having a project scope prevents scope creep, there is clear communication on what to expect in the project,it also helps the team to meet up with project standard.
work breakdown structure: is the steps reqired to complete a tast,its breaking the project into smaller parts for easy execution.
it is useful because it provides a clear roadmap for the project execution,it also helps to asign responsibilities to the team.
it allows better dudget planning and also for progress tracking
 
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

ANSWERE:detailed project schedule helps the team to stay on track,and deliver on time it also helps to prevent budget overrun and also helps in progress tracking.

gantt chart assist by displaying the project schedule in a format that makes it easy to know what is to be done and when to do it.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

ANSWERE:the software should address a particular problem that audience are facing they could include lack of job opportunities,high cost etc,these problms are significant to the targeted audience because the solution should align with their needs

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
ANSWERE: clearly defining a problem helps you work or develope based on real user problems and not based on assumption.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving  into tnechnical details?

ANSWERE: YOU can do that either by pitch deck or technical writing.communicating the solution effectively

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

ANSWERE:user friendly design/interface, jobs recomedations by AI driven tools, great insight for captures audience attention like jobs vacancies and job suggestions etc

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

ANSWERE:
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?

ANSWERE:it helps you to strategise for expansion,it helps you build a a different and better software from the competitors,it helps you to spot unmet needs and cover the gap
