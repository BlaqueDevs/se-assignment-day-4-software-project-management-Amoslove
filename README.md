## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
ANSWERE: both waterfall and agile methodologies are software development methodologies used to manage projects.
waterfall is linear,each phase of the project must be completed befor starting another starts, and it is more like a a static project where the requirement won't change, it requires extensive planning before development while agile is more flexible and focuses on small rapid cycle called sprint,agile agile is more like  dynamic project  where its reqirements are incremental, planing is continious in agile because agile can adapt to changes unlike wwaterfall.

avantage of agile:it is flexible,it easily adapt to changes and allows modification.
disadvantage:it can lead to budget overrun.

advantage of waterfall:works with a fixed budget.
